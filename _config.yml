    - question: Do you have a registry?
      answer: |
        TBD
    - question: What is the dress code?
      answer: |
        Come dressed for what it is – a garden party! Bright, cheerful colors are appreciated. Coat and tie are not required, but would not be out of place – it is standard at most French weddings and many of our French guests will wear them.

    - question: |
        Are children invited?
      answer: |
        Children are welcome! This includes the wedding day and the optional pre- and post-events. We will have lawn games and activities as well as a kids' table at dinner with a child-friendly menu. We are not hiring childcare, but there will be an apartment-style room next to the reception and dining area set aside for napping, sleeping, diapering, feeding, etc.

    - question: |
        What will the weather be like?
      answer: |
        Biscarrosse and the towns along Arcachon Bay tend to be cooler than Paris and other parts of France because of their proximity to the ocean. When we visited in July 2023, the weather was mostly overcast with temperatures in the low 70s and some rain. That said, heat waves are also possible. We will be prepared for inclement weather at La Ferme d’en Chon, and the reception hall where we will enjoy dinner together will be air conditioned.

    - question: |
        Why are you getting married in France? And why this part of France?
      answer: |
        Meredith is American and loves to travel. She grew up on Maui in Hawaiʻi, and while that is also a great place for a wedding, much of her family has already visited. Stéphane is French and his parents live in Arcachon. Getting married there means our names will be written into a wedding registry that has been maintained for centuries. When we discussed location ideas, many friends and relatives were very enthusiastic about coming to France, so that’s what we decided to do!

    - question: |
        Are you working with a wedding planner?
      answer: |
        Yes! We are working with Mathilde Iglesias of Etoiles d’un Jour. She is wonderful and has helped us find some really great local vendors.
        If you want to get in touch, she can be reached at <a href="mailto:mathilde@etoilesdunjour.com">mathilde@etoilesdunjour.com</a>.

    - question: If I rent a car, do I need a French driver's license?
      answer: |
        You don’t need a French driver’s license. An International Driving Permit is required if your driver's license is not written in the Roman alphabet. If it is written in the Roman alphabet, an International Driving Permit is recommended.
        Those coming from the U.S. can get an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html">International Driving Permit from AAA</a>. You just need a completed application, two passport photos, a valid driver’s license, and $20.

    - question: |
        What side of the road do people drive on in France? What kind of driving should we expect? 
      answer: |
        Drivers in France drive on the same side of the road as those in the U.S. There are some bigger multi-lane roundabouts in and around Bordeaux, but it is very easy driving around the smaller towns along Arcachon Bay and in Biscarrosse. Expect traffic – the area is a vacation destination known to people all over Europe that is particularly popular in summer.

    - question: |
        What are your suggestions for traveling in France before or after the wedding?
      answer: |
        In the Bordeaux and Arcachon areas, give yourself a little extra time going places to account for traffic and parking. Arcachon and Biscarrosse are popular vacation destinations for people from all over Europe.

        The towns around Arcachon host various Bastille Day celebrations in the days leading up to July 14. Bordeaux usually has a big fireworks display that starts around 11pm on Bastille day itself. We would recommend staying in Bordeaux that night.

        Bastille Day in Paris is a big event, with a televised parade down the Champs Elyseés, military flyovers, and fireworks by the Eiffel Tower. The areas with the festivities will be crowded, but you can avoid them if you want.

        The Summer Olympics will be held in Paris starting on July 26. 

    - question: |
        Where is this website hosted?
      answer: |
        Stéphane found several open source wedding website projects on GitHub using <a target="_blank" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. We decided to fork one of them and adapt it to our wedding's needs. Source code and credits are available on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/thiell/wedding">GitHub</a>, where it is also hosted. All photos are ours.
