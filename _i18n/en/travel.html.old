        We'll be coordinating transportation for events not located

        there are plenty of ways to get around.

          <p>
            First and foremost, a car is not necessary to get around to all
            the wedding fesitivites, and in fact is probably more difficult to
            manage due to limited parking and tight streets.
          </p>
          <p>
            That being said, the streets of Chicago are easy to navigate as the roads
            line up on a grid and both hotels offer parking (valet
            and self-park, for a fee.)
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6 text-left">

          <h3>Taxi</h3>

          <p>
            Hailing a cab typically isn't too hard in the city. If you don't have cash,
            all cabs are required to <strong>accept credit cards</strong>. Legally,
            cabs are not allowed to accept more passengers than there are
            seat belts in the car. That being said, it never hurts to ask :)

           The city of Chicago Transit Authority incorporates an elevated 'L' train and a system of buses. For most tourist destinations, the 'L' should get you wehre you want to go.
          </p>

            The closest 'L' station to the Hilton is the Harrison Red Line station at the corner of Harrison St. and State St.

            Hotel Burnham is equidistant from the Washington Blue Line station (at the corner of Washington St. and Dearborn St.) and the Randolph/Wabash station, which serves multiple 'L' lines.
