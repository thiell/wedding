        Since so many of our friends and family are coming from far away, we want to make it easy for them experience some of our favorite parts of the region. We also like that these events will allow people to meet and spend time with each other before and after our wedding day.

        ⚠️ The optional events have <strong>not</strong> been booked yet, so it's possible these dates will change. We intend to ask those who participate to contribute to the cost. ⚠️
