We will host a casual lunch at La Ferme d'en Chon (the wedding venue) from 12:00 to 2:30 pm. We will have an assortment of sandwiches, cheeses, salads, and "surprise bread" (a French innovation Meredith is particularly excited about).

Friends and family are invited to stop by before heading out for onward travels.
