Participants will meet at a central location in Bordeaux at 12:00 pm to board our private, chartered bus. This way no one needs to worry about drinking and driving.
</p>
<p>
Our first stop is <a href="https://www.chateaudecerons.com/">Château de Cérons</a> in the historic wine village of Cérons. It is a small, family-run winery that has used organic farming practices since 2021. We will tour the 17th century manor, its surrounding vineyards, the old barrel cellar, and the new winemaking facility. Lunch is an outdoor picnic with an assortment of local meat, produce, cheese, and pâtisserie paired with four estate wines (red, white, and orange). The dietary restrictions in your RSVP to our wedding will be taken into account for the lunch order to make sure there are plenty of tasty things for everyone to eat.

<p>
After lunch we drive to <a href="https://www.haut-bailly.com/en/home.html">Château Haut-Bailly</a> in Léognan, a top winery in the region that comes highly recommended by the travel company that runs Stanford Travel/Study's wine-focused trips. We will tour their beautiful and modern facilities, learn about their winemaking philosophy, and taste two of their Grand Crus – the highest classification possible in French wine – paired with cheese, charcuterie, and chocolate.

<p>
We will be back in Bordeaux no later than 6:00 pm.
