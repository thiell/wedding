          <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://ladunedupilat.com/en/">Dune du Pyla</a></h3>
          <p>
            The largest sand dune in Europe and one of the top places to visit in the region.
            Views of Arcachon Bay from the top are spectacular, and children enjoy playing in
            the abundance of sand. Visiting at dawn or dusk is particularly recommended.

          <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.arcachon.com/en/tourism/discovery/exceptional-locations/cap-ferret/">Cap Ferret</a></h3>
          <p>
            An extremely scenic strip of land bordered by Arcachon Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.
            There are, long strips of sandy beaches, iconic regional architecture, and the reason
            most people visit - plenty of oyster farms with their affiliated charming and unassuming
            oyster huts. For ease of exploration, driving around the Bay of Arcachon to get there
            is recommended, although it can also be reached by frequent ferry from Arcachon.

          <p>
            Saint-Émilion is a charming medieval village located in the heart of the famous Bordeaux wine area.
            It is a UNESCO-recognized area where world-class wineries, beautiful architecture, and great restaurants
            can all be found in one small, picturesque town. Bordeaux is a convenient base for a day trip to
            Saint-Émilion. You can drive on your own or join a tour. If there are any wineries you particularly
            want to visit, check to see if you need to reserve in advance.

          <p>
            An author of a National Geographic Travel article about the area raved, “I am hopelessly, crazily in love
            with everything about it: the prehistoric caves, the fairy-tale castles, and the resilient locals, who
            still call the region Périgord.” We also like its foodie accolades – the region is known for its truffles
            and duck and has an abundance of both local artisan farms and Michelin-starred restaurants. The drive is
            about 3.5 hours from Arcachon and 2.5 hours from Bordeaux.

          <p>
            With epic views, an antique train, wildlife, an abundance of hikes, and even the opportunity to sled in the
            summer months (something called “mountain luge”), it’s no surprise the mountain range that separates France
            from Spain is often called a playground for lovers of the outdoors. Plus there are regional specialties to
            try and lots of prehistoric and medieval sites.

          <h3>Pays Basque</h3>
          <p>
            Rick Steves does not include much of Southwest France in his travel guides (which we do not agree with at all).
            He does include the Pays Basque, though: “The Basque Country is famous for its beaches, culinary scene, and
            scintillating modern architecture…and for its feisty, industrious natives. It's also simply beautiful: Bright
            white chalet-style homes with deep-red and green shutters scatter across lush, rolling hills; the Pyrenees
            Mountains soar high above the Atlantic; and surfers and sardines share the waves.”

            Not technically in Southwest France, but we would be remiss if we didn’t mention that San Sebastian is only a
            2.5-hour drive away.
