          <h3>Biscarrosse Ville</h3>

          <p>
            This is the commercial center of Biscarrosse, away from the tourists at the ocean and lakes.
            It is a good place to get groceries and find a few restaurants, but it is not particularly
            attractive. We recommend staying elsewhere.

          <h3>Biscarrosse Plage</h3>

          <p>
            Biscarrosse Plage is a popular summer destination on the Atlantic coast. The beach there has
            impressive waves that attract surfers, water sports enthusiasts, and families alike. The town
            is smaller and feels a little more casual than Arcachon, and there is a walkable downtown area
            reminiscent of other beach towns with many restaurants, shops, and vacation rentals. It takes
            about 35 minutes to drive to Arcachon Town Hall from there and about 15 minutes to drive to
            La Ferme d’En Chon.

      <p>
        Arcachon and Pyla-sur-Mer are popular seaside resort towns on Arcachon Bay. They are more cosmopolitan
        than Biscarrosse and very walkable, with lots of shops, restaurants, and cafes. The calm waters of the
        Bay are ideal for children. Dune du Pilat, the tallest sand dune in Europe and one of the most popular
        destinations in France, separates these towns from Biscarrosse.

          <h3>Arcachon Ville d'Été</h3>
          <p>
           This is the downtown part of Arcachon, with many shops and cafes, a daily market, and close proximity
           to the calm waters of Arcachon Bay. If you stay here, you can walk to the town hall ceremony in the
           morning and then drive or hire a car to take you to the reception and back. The departure location
           for the Bay of Arcachon boat tour is also walkable from here.

            feel, with easy access to Arcachon Bay, an iconic church, and good restaurants. Staying here would
            require driving to both wedding events on July 13. It is about 10 minutes to Arcachon Town Hall and

            and restaurants in the area. It’s worth driving through the area even if you don’t stay.

        Bordeaux is a charming city full of restaurants, cafes, shops, and parks. It’s known for its architectural
        and cultural heritage, and of course, wine. You can easily spend a few days here sitting in cafes and
