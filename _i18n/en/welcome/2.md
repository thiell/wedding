<h2>It’s going to be a good time</h2>
<p>
More than anything we want our wedding to be a fun party. Not stuffy, not boring, just some of our favorite people hanging out together eating good food in a lovely setting. Our caterer is a well-respected local restaurant that shares our love of tasty, fresh, and local food. There will be lawn games, a photobooth, and an excellent DJ … and that’s just what we’re willing to share now :)
