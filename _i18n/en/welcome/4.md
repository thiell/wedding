<h2>French/American hybrid wedding</h2>

Our first event is a civil ceremony at city hall – which is the traditional beginning of French wedding festivities and is required for our marriage to be recognized in France. We get to do this in Arcachon because Stéphane’s parents live there. It is a particularly lovely building – lucky us!

We also wanted to have a ceremony officiated by Meredith’s father, who is a wedding officiant on Maui known for beautiful, heartfelt ceremonies crafted specifically for each couple. This ceremony will take place at our reception venue, La Ferme d’En Chon, and is where we will exchange our rings.

Most weddings in France serve dinner around 9 pm, and the dancing and merriment continues until 5 am or later. Most weddings in the U.S. serve dinner around 6 pm and conclude by 10 pm. Our celebration splits the difference – dinner will be at 7:30 pm, and we will finish no later than 2 am.
