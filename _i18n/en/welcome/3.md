<h2>Our story</h2>

<p>
Even though we both work for Stanford University, it was the online dating app Bumble that brought us together in August 2019. Our first date was at a taco restaurant near campus where we ended up talking over margaritas and just 1 taco each for 3 hours. More fun dates followed, including touring a local brewery, sailing on the San Francisco Bay in Stéphane’s sailboat while the Blue Angels soared overhead, eating at some excellent San Francisco restaurants (some of which Stéphane even found himself!), and hiking among California’s redwood trees. We moved in together at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and kept ourselves busy cooking increasingly elaborate meals and brewing beers with palindrome names like Doom Mood and Wet Stew.

We got engaged at Gamble Garden in Palo Alto in June 2022 and have been leisurely planning our wedding ever since, including taking scouting trips to Southwest France in December 2022 and July 2023. We look forward to seeing it all come together in July 2024!
